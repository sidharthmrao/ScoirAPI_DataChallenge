# api-data-challenge-public-response

## Expectations
1. This exercise is meant to drive a conversation. 
1. Please invest only enough time needed to demonstrate your approach to problem solving, code design, etc.
1. Within reason, treat your solution as if it would become a production system.

## Assignment
Write a program that retrieves 1,000 users from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API and answers the following questions about that data:
1. What is the most popular birth month?
2. How many users were born in that month?
3. What is the most popular first name of users born in that month?

Example output:
```
The most popular birth month was June with 104 users
The most popular first name of users born in June was Raymond
```
## How-To
Simply run:
```
python3 api.py
```

To run with loading prints on, run:
```
python3 api.py --load
```

## Assumptions
Python 3 is permitted as a language for conducting and processing the api-calls.
